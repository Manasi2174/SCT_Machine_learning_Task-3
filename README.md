<h4>SCT_Machine_learning_Task 3</h4>
<p>In this task I have implemented CNN Model.<br>
which classifies the images of cats and dogs from given dataset.</p>
<p> I implemented the CNN using TensorFlow with Keras as the high-level API. TensorFlowâ€™s flexibility and scalability were crucial for model building,<br> 
  while Keras made the architecture building simpler and more efficient.</p>
<p>NumPy & Matplotlib: For handling data arrays and visualizing training progress (loss, accuracy) respectively.</p>
